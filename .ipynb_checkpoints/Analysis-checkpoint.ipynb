    "The [UK Police](police.uk) have made [publically accessible data](https://data.police.uk) relating to crime in England, Wales and Northern Ireland in the form of street-level crime and outcome records for each month. The specific data I will be working with is all data collected on the Gwent Police force between 2010 and 2016 (2010 is the oldest data available openly), the reason for chosing Gwent is because it's my local county and it would be interesting to see the landscape of crime in my area!\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook will be divided into 3 main sections all of which revolve around using the data provided by the Police. The first section covers importing the data and cleaning it to be usable, thankfully the curators at the Police are good at their job and have left minimal cleaning for me to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second section involves exploring the data with no *a priori* and answering a set of questions that will be outlined in the relevant section.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally I will take a look at seeing if a model can be built to classify a crime based on information given."

    "Mentioned previously the data has been obtained from the UK Police's [open data portal](https://data.police.uk) where a collection of .csv files are provided with each .csv containing all crimes recorded for a certain month in the Gwent Police Force. The first challenge before importing the data was to merge these .csv's together, the quick and dirty way to do this was to use the command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "cat *.csv > merged.csv\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "While this merges all of the .csv files together it retains the header information of each file which will need to be removed later. Looking at the [changelog](https://data.police.uk/changelog/) of the data an issue was spotted where, *\"Gwent Police: An excessive number of crimes have been snapped to Lon Uwchmynydd for January 2015. We are working with the force to establish the cause and resolve this.\"*, this is a continuing issue and has resulted in leaving out the January 2015 as it could skew analysis and models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The newly merged .csv file is then imported into the notebook using the pandas library."

    "\n",
    "Moving from left to right along the columns we can see a number of issues already. The first is that there is a difference between overall and unique Crime ID's, this could be down to either crimes without an ID or duplicates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly the attributes *Reported by* and *Falls within* both have two unique values when in reality they should only have one (Gwent Police), without looking at the data first I would say that the issue here is the duplicate headers that are still in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thirdly, *Context* has only 64 values each of which is the word \"Context\", this is once again because of the duplicate headers from each separate .csv file but this can be rectified easily by removing the Context column as it provides no information to use."

    "So we have 188927 empty Crime ID's, that's over half of the crime records having a missing ID! This could be an issue and a better way to index the data may be to use an arbitrary index but retain this Crime ID data in case it is useful later on. One thing we can deal with is duplicate ID's! The code below removes duplicates based on ID and doesn't remove NaN ID's."
